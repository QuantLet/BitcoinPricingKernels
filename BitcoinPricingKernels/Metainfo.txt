Published in: 'Pricing Kernels inferred from Bitcoin Options'
Description: 'Bitcoin Pricing Kernels are inferred using a novel data set from Deribit, one of the largest Bitcoin derivatives exchanges. This enables arbitrage-free pricing of various instruments. State Price Densities are estimated nonparametrically. The underlying asset process is viewed through the lens of a Stochastic Volatility with Correlated Jumps (SVCJ) framework. Shape invariant pricing kernels are reported. Market inefficiencies are assessed based on the shape of the pricing kernels. A trading strategy that exploits these inefficiencies is evaluated.'
